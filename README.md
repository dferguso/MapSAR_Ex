IGT4SAR (MapSAR_Ex)
=========
This is the official copy of the map Template "Integrated Geospatial Tools for Search and Rescue" (IGT4SAR).  This template was previously known as MapSAR_Ex as it was originally intended to be an expanded version of MapSAR.  However, after significant changes were introduced between MapSAR and MapSAR_Ex it become clear that the two templates were no longer similiar.  To reduce confusion, MapSAR_Ex was renamed IGT4SAR although the term MapSAR_Ex is still used throughout the IGT4SAR template.

Installation
============
The installation process for IGT4SAR doe snot include an edit to the registry that would let Windows know where the folders are located.  Becuase some of the scripts include with IGT4SAR rely on knowing where IGT4SAR has been installed, you must install IGT4SAR in the following folder: "C:\MapSAR_Ex".

When downloading the zip from GitHub the zip file is name "MapSAR_Ex-master.zip.  This creates a problem when unzipping the file as it will create a folder called "MapSAR_Ex-master" as opposed to the required "MapSAR_Ex".  To correct this problem, merely rename the unzipped folder MapSAR_Ex and place it in your root directory.  Once properly installed you should have the following:

C:\MapSAR_Ex\
<br>Tools
<br>Template
<br>prepMap
<br>Documentation
<br>Extras
<br>MapSAR_EX_Setup.pdf
<br>~UninstallMapSAREXTools.bat
<br>~LoadMapSAREXTools.bat
