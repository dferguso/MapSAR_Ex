Installation
============
The installation process for IGT4SAR doe snot include an edit to the registry that would let Windows know where 
the folders are located.  Becuase some of the scripts include with IGT4SAR rely on knowing where IGT4SAR has 
been installed, you must install IGT4SAR in the following folder: "C:\MapSAR_Ex".

When downloading the zip from GitHub the zip file is name "MapSAR_Ex-master.zip.  This creates a problem when 
unzipping the file as it will create a folder called "MapSAR_Ex-master" as opposed to the required "MapSAR_Ex".  
To correct this problem, merely rename the unzipped folder MapSAR_Ex and place it in your root directory.  Once 
properly installed you should have the following:

C:\MapSAR_Ex\
