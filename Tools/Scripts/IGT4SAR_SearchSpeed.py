# Name:        Search Area Speed (SearchSpeed.py)
# Purpose:
#  User must run Cost Distance Model prior to running this script.
#  Baseline segment search speed based on an average 5 km per hour rate along a
#  flat, open space.  Search time varied based on slope, vegetation (NLCD),
#  availability of raods and trails, and inaccessibility due to large bodies of
#  water (large streams, river, lakes and ponds).
